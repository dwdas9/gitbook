### **How to Configure Automatic Wi-Fi Connection:**

1. **Access Network Settings:**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Network & Internet** → **Wi-Fi**.
   - Locate the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to automatically (in this case, your iPhone’s hotspot).

2. **Open Wi-Fi Properties:**
   - Click on the **Edit** button or equivalent option next to the selected network.

3. **Enable Automatic Connection:**
   - In the network properties window, check the box labeled **"Connect automatically when this network is in range."**

4. **Enable Connection Even for Hidden SSID:**
   - Scroll down to find and select the option **"Connect even if the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID)."**
   - This ensures your computer attempts to connect even if the Wi-Fi network is hidden.

5. **Save and Confirm:**
   - Click **OK** or **Apply** to save your changes.

6. **Restart or Verify:**
   - Test by restarting your computer to ensure it automatically connects to the Wi-Fi network.

### **Why This is Useful for Remote Desktop (RDP):**

- If your desktop does not have a monitor, configuring automatic Wi-Fi ensures it connects to the internet at startup.
- Once connected, you can remotely access the machine via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) without needing manual intervention.
