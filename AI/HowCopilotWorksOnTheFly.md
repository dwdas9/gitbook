# How Coipiolt Works On-the-Fly with URLs

Copilot's ability to automatically retrieve and use answers from a URL is due to the following key factors:

---

## 1. Integration with Advanced Retrieval Systems  
    - Copilot is integrated with backend systems that use advanced APIs and retrieval mechanisms.
    - When you input a URL, Copilot likely sends the content of that URL (like the webpage text or data) to a specialized retrieval engine that processes it in real time.

---

## 2. Automated Preprocessing Pipelines  
    - When you paste a URL into Copilot, it can fetch the content, clean it (extracting relevant text), and automatically embed or analyze it to get the right answers.  
    - Normal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setups require you to:  
      - Fetch and preprocess the content manually.  
      - Chunk and embed the data.  
      - Query a vector database for similarity matches.  
      - Generate an answer.  
    - Copilot handles this pipeline seamlessly in the background.

## 3. On-the-Fly Document Indexing  
    - In RAG systems, you often need to preprocess data and upload it to a vector store before querying.
    - Copilot, however, can dynamically index and vectorize a document or webpage at runtime:
      - It extracts text.
      - Creates embeddings using OpenAI or Azure models.  
      - Performs a similarity search against the new embeddings.  
    - This dynamic indexing eliminates the need for a pre-built vector database.

---

## 4. Context Management and Prompt Engineering  
    - Copilot also effectively manages context by appending the extracted URL content directly into the prompt as part of its input.
    - This makes it seem like the system "understood" the URL effortlessly because it is using in-context learning rather than a pre-stored vector search.

---

## Why Doesnâ€™t Normal RAG Do This Automatically?  
In a normal RAG pipeline, manual steps often hinder such seamless experiences:
- You typically fetch and preprocess data beforehand.
- You store embeddings in a vector database and retrieve similar chunks later.
- On-the-fly embedding and querying are not commonly implemented in basic RAG setups.
