# How to Upload a Folder to GitHub and Create a Repo  

If you have a folder on your computer that you want to upload to GitHub and turn into a repository, here’s a simple step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub  
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.  
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.  
3. Give your repository a name and choose whether you want it to be **Public** or **Private**.  
4. **Don’t check** the options to add a README, `.gitignore`, or license.  
5. Click **Create repository**.  

Once done, GitHub will give you a link to the new repository. You’ll need this link in the next step.

## Step 2: Upload Your Folder  

### Option 1: Using the Command Line  
If you’re comfortable with a terminal, this is quick and straightforward.  

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**.  
2. Go to the folder you want to upload:  
   ```bash  
   cd path/to/your/folder  
   ```  
3. Initialize Git in that folder:  
   ```bash  
   git init  
   ```  
4. Connect the folder to your new GitHub repository:  
   ```bash  
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git  
   ```  
5. Add all the files to Git:  
   ```bash  
   git add .  
   ```  
6. Commit the files with a message:  
   ```bash  
   git commit -m "Initial commit"  
   ```  
7. Push the folder to GitHub:  
   ```bash  
   git branch -M main  
   git push -u origin main  
   ```  

Done! Your folder is now live on GitHub.

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop  
If you prefer a tool with a user interface, GitHub Desktop makes this easy:  
1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).  
2. Open the app, log in, and go to **File → Add Local Repository**.  
3. Select the folder you want to upload.  
4. Click **Publish repository**.  
5. Add a name, description, and choose visibility (Public/Private).  
6. Click **Publish**.

### Option 3: Upload via the GitHub Website  
If your folder is small and you don’t want to use Git, you can upload it directly:  
1. Go to your new repository on GitHub.  
2. Click **“Add file” → “Upload files”**.  
3. Drag and drop your folder or manually upload the files inside it.  
4. Add a commit message and click **Commit changes**.

And that’s it! Now your folder is uploaded to GitHub and ready to share or collaborate. Pick the method that works best for you, and you’ll have your repo up and running in no time.
